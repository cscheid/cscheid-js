### Stuff I use to drive cscheid.net

This repo contains a bunch of code I use repeatedly at
cscheid.net. It's also a chance for me to experiment
with native support for ES6 modules. 

I try to keep this relatively clean of other dependencies,
which means there's a fair amount of code that I just
imported from other sources. It also means it's unlikely
that this will be useful for other people.
